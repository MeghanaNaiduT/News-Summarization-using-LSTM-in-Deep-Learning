#ðŸ§  Text Summarization using LSTM (Deep Learning Approach)
This project focuses on extractive and abstractive text summarization of news articles using deep learning techniques, specifically an LSTM-based sequence-to-sequence model. The goal is to compress long-form news content into concise summaries while retaining the key information.
